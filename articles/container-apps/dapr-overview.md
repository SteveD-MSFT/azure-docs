# Dapr integration with Azure Container Apps

[Distributed Application Runtime (Dapr)][dapr-concepts] provides APIs that run as a sidecar process that helps you write and implement simple, portable, resilient, and secured microservices. Dapr works together with Azure Container Apps as an abstraction layer to provide a low-maintenance, serverless, and scalable platform. [Enabling Dapr on your container app][dapr-enable] creates a secondary process alongside your application code that simplifies application intercommunication with Dapr via HTTP or gRPC.

## Dapr in Azure Container Apps

Configure Dapr for your container apps environment with a [Dapr-enabled container app][dapr-enable], a [Dapr component configured for your solution][dapr-components], and a Dapr sidecar invoking communication between them. The following diagram demonstrates these core concepts related to Dapr in Azure Container Apps.

| Label | Dapr settings                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | Container Apps with Dapr enabled | Dapr is enabled at the container app level by configuring a set of Dapr arguments. These values apply to all revisions of a given container app when running in multiple revisions mode.                                                                                           |
| 2     | Dapr                             | The fully managed Dapr APIs are exposed to each container app through a Dapr sidecar. The Dapr APIs can be invoked from your container app via HTTP or gRPC. The Dapr sidecar runs on HTTP port 3500 and gRPC port 50001.                                                         |
| 3     | Dapr component configuration     | Dapr uses a modular design where functionality is delivered as a component. Dapr components can be shared across multiple container apps. The Dapr app identifiers provided in the scopes array dictate which dapr-enabled container apps load a given component at runtime. |

## Supported Dapr APIs

Azure Container Apps offers fully managed versions of the following _stable_ Dapr APIs (building blocks). To learn more about using alpha APIs and features, [see the Dapr FAQ][dapr-faq].

| Dapr API                                              | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**Service-to-service invocation**][dapr-serviceinvo] | Discover services and perform reliable, direct service-to-service calls with automatic mTLS authentication and encryption. [See known limitations for Dapr service invocation in Azure Container Apps.](#limitations)                                     |
| [**State management**][dapr-statemgmt]                | Provides state management capabilities for transactions and CRUD operations.                                                                                    |
| [**Pub/sub**][dapr-pubsub]                            | Allows publisher and subscriber container apps to intercommunicate via an intermediary message broker. You can also create [declarative subscriptions][dapr-subscriptions] to a topic using an external component JSON file. [Learn more about the declarative pub/sub API.][declarative-pubsub]                                                         |
| [**Bindings**][dapr-bindings]                         | Trigger your applications based on events                                                                                                                       |
| [**Actors**][dapr-actors]                             | Dapr actors are message-driven, single-threaded, units of work designed to quickly scale. For example, in burst-heavy workload situations. |
| [**Observability**](./observability.md)               | Send tracing information to an Application Insights backend.                                                                                                    |
| [**Secrets**][dapr-secrets]                           | Access secrets from your application code or reference secure values in your Dapr components.                                                                   |
| [**Configuration**][dapr-config]                           | Retrieve and subscribe to application configuration items for supported configuration stores.                                                                   |

## Limitations

- **Dapr Configuration spec**: Any capabilities that require use of the Dapr configuration spec.
- **Any Dapr sidecar annotations not listed in [the Dapr enablement guide][dapr-enable]**
- **Alpha APIs and components**: Azure Container Apps doesn't guarantee the availability of Dapr alpha APIs and features. For more information, see the [Dapr FAQ][dapr-faq].
- **Actor reminders**: Require a minReplicas of 1+ to ensure reminders is always active and fires correctly.
- **Jobs**: Dapr isn't supported for jobs.
