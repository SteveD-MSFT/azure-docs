# Data collection rules in Azure Monitor
Data collection rules (DCRs) are sets of instructions supporting [data collection in Azure Monitor](../essentials/data-collection.md). They provide a consistent and centralized way to define and customize different data collection scenarios. Depending on the scenario, DCRs specify such details as what data should be collected, how to transform that data, and where to send it. 

DCRs are stored in Azure so that you can centrally manage them. Different components of a data collection workflow will access the DCR for particular information that it requires. In some cases, you can use the Azure portal to configure data collection, and Azure Monitor will create and manage the DCR for you. Other scenarios will require you to create your own DCR. You may also choose to customize an existing DCR to meet your required functionality.


## Basic operation
One example of how DCRs are used is the Logs Ingestion API that allows you to send custom data to Azure Monitor. This scenario is illustrated in the following diagram. Prior to using the API, you create a DCR that defines the structure of the data that you're going to send and the Log Analytics workspace and table that will receive the data. If the data needs to be formatted before it's stored, you can include a [transformation](data-collection-transformations.md) in the DCR.

Each call to the API specifies the DCR to use, and Azure Monitor references this DCR to determine what to do with the incoming data. If your requirements change, you can modify the DCR without making any changes to the application sending the data.

## Data collection rule associations (DCRAs)
Data collection rule associations (DCRAs) associate a DCR with an object being monitored, for example a virtual machine with the Azure Monitor agent (AMA). A single object can be associated with multiple DCRs, and a single DCR can be associated with multiple objects.

The following diagram illustrates data collection for the Azure Monitor agent. When the agent is installed, it connects to Azure Monitor to retrieve any DCRs that are associated with it. It then references the data sources section of each DCR to determine what data to collect from the machine. When the agent delivers this data,  Azure Monitor references other sections of the DCR to determine whether a transformation should be applied to it and then the workspace and table to send it to.

## View data collection rules
There are multiple ways to view the DCRs in your subscription.

### [Portal](#tab/portal)
To view your DCRs in the Azure portal, select **Data Collection Rules** under **Settings** on the **Monitor** menu.

:::image type="content" source="media/data-collection-rule-overview/view-data-collection-rules.png" lightbox="media/data-collection-rule-overview/view-data-collection-rules.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows DCRs in the Azure portal.":::

Select a DCR to view its details. For DCRs supporting VMs, you can view and modify its associations and the data that it collects. For other DCRs, use the **JSON view** to view the details of the DCR. See [Create and edit data collection rules (DCRs) in Azure Monitor](./data-collection-rule-create-edit.md) for details on how you can modify them.

> [!NOTE]
> Although this view shows all DCRs in the specified subscriptions, selecting the **Create** button will create a data collection for Azure Monitor Agent. Similarly, this page will only allow you to modify DCRs for Azure Monitor Agent. For guidance on how to create and update DCRs for other workflows, see [Create and edit data collection rules (DCRs) in Azure Monitor](./data-collection-rule-create-edit.md).

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)
Use [Get-AzDataCollectionRule](/powershell/module/az.monitor/get-azdatacollectionrule) to retrieve the DCRs in your subscription.


```powershell
Get-AzDataCollectionRule 
```

Use [Get-azDataCollectionRuleAssociation](/powershell/module/az.monitor/get-azdatacollectionruleassociation) to retrieve the DCRs associated with a VM. 

```powershell
get-azDataCollectionRuleAssociation -TargetResourceId /subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/my-vm | foreach {Get-azDataCollectionRule -RuleId $_.DataCollectionRuleId }
```

### [CLI](#tab/cli)
Use [az monitor data-collection rule](/cli/azure/monitor/data-collection/rule) to work the DCRs using Azure CLI.

Use the following to return all DCRs in your subscription.

```azurecli
az monitor data-collection rule list
```

Use the following to return DCR associations for a VM.

```azurecli
az monitor data-collection rule association list --resource "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/my-resource-group/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/my-vm "
```

## Supported regions
Data collection rules are available in all public regions where Log Analytics workspaces and the Azure Government and China clouds are supported. Air-gapped clouds aren't yet supported.

**Single region data residency** is a preview feature to enable storing customer data in a single region and is currently only available in the Southeast Asia Region (Singapore) of the Asia Pacific Geo and the Brazil South (Sao Paulo State) Region of the Brazil Geo. Single-region residency is enabled by default in these regions.

## Data resiliency and high availability
A DCR gets created and stored in a particular region and is backed up to the [paired-region](../../availability-zones/cross-region-replication-azure.md#azure-paired-regions) within the same geography. The service is deployed to all three [availability zones](../../availability-zones/az-overview.md#availability-zones) within the region. For this reason, it's a *zone-redundant service*, which further increases availability.

## Next steps
