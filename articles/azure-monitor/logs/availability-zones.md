# Enhance data and service resilience in Azure Monitor Logs with availability zones

[Azure availability zones](../../reliability/availability-zones-overview.md) protect applications and data from datacenter failures and can enhance the resilience of Azure Monitor features that rely on a Log Analytics workspace. This article describes the data and service resilience benefits Azure Monitor availability zones provide by default to [dedicated clusters](logs-dedicated-clusters.md) in supported regions.

## Prerequisites

- A Log Analytics workspace linked to a [dedicated cluster](logs-dedicated-clusters.md).  

    > [!NOTE]
    > Application Insights resources can use availability zones only if they're workspace-based and the workspace uses a dedicated cluster. Classic Application Insights resources can't use availability zones.

## How availability zones enhance data and service resilience in Azure Monitor Logs

Each Azure region that supports availability zones is made of one or more datacenters, or zones, equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking infrastructure. 

Azure Monitor Logs availability zones are [zone-redundant](../../reliability/availability-zones-overview.md#zonal-and-zone-redundant-services), which means that Microsoft manages spreading service requests and replicating data across different zones in supported regions. If one zone is affected by an incident, Microsoft manages failover to a different availability zone in the region automatically. You don't need to take any action because switching between zones is seamless. 

A subset of the availability zones that support data resilience currently also support service resilience for Azure Monitor Logs, as listed in the [Service resilience - supported regions](#service-resilience---supported-regions) section. In regions that support service resilience, Azure Monitor Logs service operations - for example, log ingestion, queries, and alerts - can continue in the event of a zone failure. In regions that only support data resilience, your stored data is protected against zonal failures, but service operations might be impacted by regional incidents.
    
## Data resilience - supported regions

Azure Monitor creates Log Analytics workspaces in a shared cluster, unless you [set up a dedicated cluster](../logs/logs-dedicated-clusters.md) for your workspaces.

### Shared clusters (default)
All shared clusters in the following regions use availability zones. If your workspace is in one of these regions, Azure Monitor replicates your logs across the region-specific zones, as of January 2024.

* Canada Central
* France Central
* North Europe
* South Central US
* Southeast Asia
* UK South
* West US 3

### Dedicated clusters
Azure Monitor currently supports data resilience for availability-zone-enabled dedicated clusters in these regions:

  | Americas | Europe | Middle East | Africa | Asia Pacific |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | Brazil South | France Central | Qatar Central | South Africa North | Australia East |
  | Canada Central | Germany West Central | UAE North | | Central India | 
  | Central US | North Europe | Israel Central | | Japan East |
  | East US | Norway East | | | Korea Central |
  | East US 2 | UK South | | | Southeast Asia |
  | South Central US | West Europe | | | East Asia |
  | West US 2 | Sweden Central | | |  |
  | West US 3 | Switzerland North | | |  |
  | | Poland Central | | | |
  | | Italy North | | | |

> [!NOTE]
> Moving to a dedicated cluster in a region that supports availablility zones protects data ingested after the move, not historical data.

## Service resilience - supported regions

When available in your region, Azure Monitor availability zones enhance your Azure Monitor service resilience automatically. Physical separation and independent infrastructure makes interruption of service availability in your Log Analytics workspace far less likely because the Log Analytics workspace can rely on resources from a different zone. 

Azure Monitor currently supports service resilience for availability-zone-enabled dedicated clusters in these regions:

- East US 2
- West US 2
- North Europe
