# What is Azure AI Studio?

[!INCLUDE [Azure AI Studio preview](./includes/preview-ai-studio.md)]

Azure AI Studio brings together capabilities from across multiple Azure AI services.

[Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com) is designed for developers to:

- Build generative AI applications on an enterprise-grade platform. 
- Directly from the studio you can interact with a project code-first via the Azure AI SDK and Azure AI CLI. 
- Azure AI Studio is a trusted and inclusive platform that empowers developers of all abilities and preferences to innovate with AI and shape the future. 
- Seamlessly explore, build, test, and deploy using cutting-edge AI tools and ML models, grounded in responsible AI practices. 
- Build together as one team. Your Azure AI resource provides enterprise-grade security, and a collaborative environment with shared files and connections to pretrained models, data and compute.
- Organize your way. Your project helps you save state, allowing you iterate from first idea, to first prototype, and then first production deployment. Also easily invite others to collaborate along this journey.

With Azure AI Studio, you can evaluate large language model (LLM) responses and orchestrate prompt application components with prompt flow for better performance. The platform facilitates scalability for transforming proof of concepts into full-fledged production with ease. Continuous monitoring and refinement support long-term success.  

## Getting around in Azure AI Studio

Wherever you're at or going in Azure AI Studio, use the Home, Explore, Build, and Manage tabs to find your way around.


# [Home](#tab/home)

The introduction to Azure AI, with information about what's new, access to any existing projects, a curated selection of Azure AI experiences, and links to learning resources.

# [Explore](#tab/explore)

This is where you can find a model, service, or solution to start working on. The goal is that you can find, and try, all of Azure AI from here. Explore is stateless, so when you want to save settings and assets such as data you create a project and continue on the [Build](?tabs=build) page. 

- Explore has a growing suite of tools, patterns, and guidance on how to build with AI so that enterprise can scale PoCs with a paved path to full production.
- Guidance about how to select the right models and tools based on your use case.
- Test AI solutions with your app code and data and receive guidance on standardized methods to evaluate the model, prompt, and overall application pipeline.
- The try-out and model catalog cards provide an easy way to spin up a new project or add to an existing project.

# [Build](#tab/build)

Build is an experience where AI Devs and ML Pros can build or customize AI solutions and models. Developers can switch between studio and code.

- Simplified development of large language model (LLM) solutions and copilots with end-to-end app templates and prompt samples for common use cases.
- Orchestration framework to handle the complex mapping of functions and code between LLMs, tools, custom code, prompts, data, search indexes, and more.
- Evaluate, deploy, and continuously monitor your AI application and app performance 

:::image type="content" source="./media/explore/ai-studio-tab-build.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the signed-out Azure AI Studio Build page." lightbox="./media/explore/ai-studio-tab-build.png":::

# [Manage](#tab/manage)

As a developer, you can manage settings such as connections and compute. Your admin will mainly use this section to look at access control, usage, and billing.

- Centralized backend infrastructure to reduce complexity for developers
- A single Azure AI resource for enterprise configuration, unified data story, and built-in governance
