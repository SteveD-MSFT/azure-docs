# How to view evaluation results in Azure AI Studio

[!INCLUDE [Azure AI Studio preview](../includes/preview-ai-studio.md)]

The Azure AI Studio's evaluation page is a versatile hub that not only allows you to visualize and assess your results but also serves as a control center for optimizing, troubleshooting, and selecting the ideal AI model for your deployment needs. It's a one-stop solution for data-driven decision-making and performance enhancement in your AI projects. You can seamlessly access and interpret the results from various sources, including your flow, the playground quick test session, evaluation submission UI, generative SDK and CLI. This flexibility ensures that you can interact with your results in a way that best suits your workflow and preferences.  

Once you've visualized your evaluation results, you can dive into a thorough examination. This includes the ability to not only view individual results but also to compare these results across multiple evaluation runs. By doing so, you can identify trends, patterns, and discrepancies, gaining invaluable insights into the performance of your AI system under various conditions. 

In this article you learn to: 

- View the evaluation result and metrics 
- Compare the evaluation results 
- Understand the built-in evaluation metrics 
- Improve the performance  
- View the evaluation results and metrics 

## Find your evaluation results

Upon submitting your evaluation, you can locate the submitted evaluation run within the run list by navigating to the 'Evaluation' tab. 

You can oversee your evaluation runs within the run list. With the flexibility to modify the columns using the column editor and implement filters, you can customize and create your own version of the run list. Additionally, you have the ability to swiftly review the aggregated evaluation metrics across the runs, enabling you to perform quick comparisons.

For a deeper understanding of how the evaluation metrics are derived, you can access a comprehensive explanation by selecting the 'Understand more about metrics' option. This detailed resource provides valuable insights into the calculation and interpretation of the metrics used in the evaluation process.

You can choose a specific run, which will take you to the run detail page. Here, you can access comprehensive information, including evaluation details such as task type, prompt, temperature, and more. Furthermore, you can view the metrics associated with each data sample. The metrics scores charts provide a visual representation of how scores are distributed for each metric throughout your dataset.  

:::image type="content" source="../media/evaluations/view-results/evaluation-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the evaluation details and metrics scores." lightbox="../media/evaluations/view-results/evaluation-details.png":::

Within the metrics detail table, you can conduct a comprehensive examination of each individual data sample. Here, you have the ability to scrutinize both the generated output and its corresponding evaluation metric score. This level of detail enables you to make data-driven decisions and take specific actions to improve your model's performance. 

Some potential action items based on the evaluation metrics could include: 

- Pattern Recognition: By filtering for numerical values and metrics, you can drill down to samples with lower scores. Investigate these samples to identify recurring patterns or issues in your model's responses. For instance, you might notice that low scores often occur when the model generates content on a certain topic. 
- Model Refinement: Use the insights from lower-scoring samples to improve the system prompt instruction or fine-tune your model. If you observe consistent issues with, for example, coherence or relevance, you can also adjust the model's training data or parameters accordingly. 
- Column Customization: The column editor empowers you to create a customized view of the table, focusing on the metrics and data that are most relevant to your evaluation goals. This can streamline your analysis and help you spot trends more effectively. 
- Keyword Search: The search box allows you to look for specific words or phrases in the generated output. This can be useful for pinpointing issues or patterns related to particular topics or keywords and addressing them specifically. 

The metrics detail table offers a wealth of data that can guide your model improvement efforts, from recognizing patterns to customizing your view for efficient analysis and refining your model based on identified issues. 

Here are some examples of the metrics results for the question answering scenario:

If there's something wrong with the run, you can also debug your evaluation run with the log and trace. 

Here are some examples of the logs that you can use to debug your evaluation run:

And here's an example of the trace:

To learn more about how the evaluation results are produced, select the **View in flow** button to navigate to the flow page linked to the evaluation run.

## Compare the evaluation results 

To facilitate a comprehensive comparison between two or more runs, you have the option to select the desired runs and initiate the process by selecting either the 'Compare' button or, for a general detailed dashboard view, the 'Switch to dashboard view' button. This feature empowers you to analyze and contrast the performance and outcomes of multiple runs, allowing for more informed decision-making and targeted improvements. 

:::image type="content" source="../media/evaluations/view-results/compare-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the option to compare evaluations." lightbox="../media/evaluations/view-results/compare-button.png":::

In the dashboard view, you have access to two valuable components: the metric distribution comparison chart and the comparison table. These tools enable you to perform a side-by-side analysis of the selected evaluation runs, allowing you to compare various aspects of each data sample with ease and precision.  

:::image type="content" source="../media/evaluations/view-results/dashboard-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the metric evaluations page with the option to select manual evaluations." lightbox="../media/evaluations/view-results/dashboard-view.png":::

Within the comparison table, you have the capability to establish a baseline for your comparison by hovering over the specific run you wish to use as the reference point and set as baseline. Moreover, by activating the 'Show delta' toggle, you can readily visualize the differences between the baseline run and the other runs for numerical values. Additionally, with the 'Show only difference' toggle enabled, the table displays only the rows that differ among the selected runs, aiding in the identification of distinct variations. 

Using these comparison features, you can make an informed decision to select the best version: 

- Baseline Comparison: By setting a baseline run, you can identify a reference point against which to compare the other runs. This allows you to see how each run deviates from your chosen standard. 
- Numerical Value Assessment: Enabling the 'Show delta' option helps you understand the extent of the differences between the baseline and other runs. This is useful for evaluating how various runs perform in terms of specific evaluation metrics. 
- Difference Isolation: The 'Show only difference' feature streamlines your analysis by highlighting only the areas where there are discrepancies between runs. This can be instrumental in pinpointing where improvements or adjustments are needed.

By using these comparison tools effectively, you can identify which version of your model or system performs the best in relation to your defined criteria and metrics, ultimately assisting you in selecting the most optimal option for your application.

## Understand the built-in evaluation metrics   

Understanding the built-in metrics is vital for assessing the performance and effectiveness of your AI application. By gaining insights into these key measurement tools, you are better equipped to interpret the results, make informed decisions, and fine-tune your application to achieve optimal outcomes. To learn more about the significance of each metric, how it's being calculated, its role in evaluating different aspects of your model, and how to interpret the results to make data-driven improvements, please refer to [Evaluation and Monitoring Metrics](../concepts/evaluation-metrics-built-in.md).
