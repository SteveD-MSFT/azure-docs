# Generate AI-simulated datasets with your application

[!INCLUDE [Azure AI Studio preview](../includes/preview-ai-studio.md)]

Large language models are known for their few-shot and zero-shot learning abilities, allowing them to function with minimal data. However, this limited data availability impedes thorough evaluation and optimization when you don't have test datasets to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of your generative AI application. Using GPT to simulate a user interaction with your application, with configurable tone, task and characteristics can help with stress testing your application under various environments, effectively gauging how a model responds to different inputs and scenarios.

There are two main scenarios for generating a simulated interaction (such as conversation with a chat bot):
- Instance level with manual testing: generate one conversation at a time by manually inputting the task parameters such as name, profile, tone and task and iteratively tweaking it to see different outcomes for the simulated interaction. 
- Bulk testing and evaluation orchestration: generate multiple interaction data samples (~100) at one time for a list of tasks or profiles to create a target dataset to evaluate your generative AI applications and streamline the data gathering/prep process.

## Usage

The simulator works by setting up a system large language model such as GPT to simulate a user and interact with your application. It takes in task parameters that specify what task you want the simulator to accomplish in interacting with your application and giving character and tone to the simulator.  First import the simulator package from Azure AI SDK:

```python
from azure.ai.generative import Simulator, SimulatorTemplate
```

## Initialize large language model

First we set up the system large language model, which acts as the "agent" simulating a user or test case against your application.

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.ai.resources.client import AIClient
from azure.ai.generative.entities import AzureOpenAIModelConfiguration

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
# initialize aiclient. This assumes that config.json downloaded from ai workspace is present in the working directory
ai_client = AIClient.from_config(credential)

# Retrieve default aoai connection if it exists
aoai_connection = client.get_default_aoai_connection()
# alternatively, retrieve connection by name
# aoai_connection = ai_client.connections.get("<name of connection>")

# Specify model and deployment name
aoai_config = AzureOpenAIModelConfiguration.from_connection(
    connection=aoai_connection,
    model_name="<model name>",
    deployment_name="<deployment name>",
    "temperature": 0.1,
    "max_token": 300
)
```
`max_tokens` and `temperature` are optional, the default value for `max_tokens` is 300, the default value for `temperature` is 0.9

## Initialize simulator class 

`Simulator` class supports interacting between a large language model and a local app function that follows a protocol, a local flow or a large language model endpoint (just the configuration need to be passed in). 

```python
simulator = simulator(userConnection=your_target_LLM, systemConnection=aoai_config)
```

`SimulatorTemplate` class provides scenario prompt templates to simulate certain large language model scenarios such as conversations/chats or summarization.

```python
st = SimulatorTemplate()
```

The following is an example of providing a local function or local flow, and wrapping it in the `simulate_callback` function:

```python
async def simulate_callback(question, conversation_history, meta_data):
    from promptflow import PFClient
    pf_client = PFClient()

    inputs = {"question": question}
    return pf_client.test(flow="<flow_folder_path>", inputs=inputs)
```

Then pass the `simulate_callback` function in the `simulate()` function:

```python
simulator = simulator(simulate_callback=simulate_callback, systemConnection=aoai_config)
```

## Simulate a conversation

Use simulator template provided for conversations using the `SimulatorTemplate` class configure the parameters for that task.
```python
conversation_template = st.get_template("conversation")
conversation_parameters = st.get_template_parameters("conversation")
print(conversation_parameters) # shows parameters needed for the prompt template
print(conversation_template) # shows the prompt template that is used to generate conversations
```

Configure the parameters for the simulated task (we support conversation and summarization) as a dictionary with the name of your simulated agent, its profile description, tone, task and any extra metadata you want to provide as part of the persona or task. You can also configure the name of your chat application bot to ensure that the simulator knows what it's interacting with. 

```python
conversation_parameters = {
    "name": "Cortana",
    "profile":"Cortana is a enterprising businesswoman in her 30's looking for ways to improve her hiking experience outdoors in California.",
    "tone":"friendly",
    "metadata":{"customer_info":"Last purchased item is a OnTrail ProLite Tent on October 13, 2023"},
    "task":"Cortana is looking to complete her camping set to go on an expedition in Patagonia, Chile.",
    "chatbot_name":"YourChatAppNameHere"
}
```
Simulate either synchronously or asynchronously, the `simulate` function accepts three inputs: persona, task and max_conversation_turns. 
```python
conversation_result = simulator.simulate(template=conversation_template, parameters=conversation_parameters, max_conversation_turns = 6, max_token = 300, temperature = 0.9)
conversation_result = await simulator.simulate(template=conversation_template, parameters=conversation_parameters, max_conversation_turns = 6, max_token = 300, temperature = 0.9)
```
`max_conversation_turns` defines how many conversation turns it generates at most. It's optional, default value is 2.

## Output

The `conversation_result` is a dictionary,

The `conversation` is a list of conversation turns, for each conversation turn, it contains `content` which is the content of conversation, `role` which is either the user (simulated agent) or assistant,`turn_number`,`template_parameters`
```json
{
    "messages": [
        {
            "content": "<conversation_turn_content>", 
            "role": "<role_name>", 
            "turn_number": "<turn_number>",
            "template_parameters": {
                "name": "<name_of_simulated_agent>",
                "profile": "<description_of_simulated_agent>",
                "tone": "<tone_description>",
                "metadata": {
                    "<content_key>":"<content_value>"
                },
                "task": "<task_description>",
                "chatbot_name": "<name_of_chatbot>"
            },
            "context": {
                "citations": [
                    {
                        "id": "<content_key>",
                        "content": "<content_value>"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
This aligns to Azure AI SDK's `evaluate` function call that takes in this chat format dataset for evaluating metrics such as groundedness, relevance, and retrieval_score if `citations` are provided.

## More functionality

### Early termination

Stop conversation earlier if the conversation meets certain criteria, such as "bye" or "goodbye" appears in the conversation. Users can customize the stopping criteria themselves as well.

### Retry

The scenario simulator supports retry logic, the default maximum number of retries in case the last API call failed is 3. The default number of seconds to sleep between consequent retries in case the last API call failed is 3.

Users can also define their own `api_call_retry_sleep_sec` and `api_call_retry_max_count` and pass into the `simulator()` function.
