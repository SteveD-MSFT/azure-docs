# Python tool for flows in Azure AI Studio

[!INCLUDE [Azure AI Studio preview](../../includes/preview-ai-studio.md)]

The prompt flow *Python* tool offers customized code snippets as self-contained executable nodes. You can quickly create Python tools, edit code, and verify results.

## Build with the Python tool

1. Create or open a flow in Azure AI Studio. For more information, see [Create a flow](../flow-develop.md).
1. Select **+ Python** to add the Python tool to your flow.

1. Enter values for the Python tool input parameters described [here](#inputs). For example, in the **Code** input text box you can enter the following Python code:

    ```python
    from promptflow import tool

    @tool
    def my_python_tool(message: str) -> str:
        return 'hello ' + message
    ```

    For more information, see [Python code input requirements](#python-code-input-requirements).

1. Add more tools to your flow as needed, or select **Run** to run the flow.
1. The outputs are described [here](#outputs). Given the previous example Python code input, if the input message is "world", the output is `hello world`.


## Inputs

The list of inputs will change based on the arguments of the tool function, after you save the code. Adding type to arguments and return values help the tool show the types properly.

| Name   | Type   | Description                                          | Required |
|--------|--------|------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Code   | string | Python code snippet                                  | Yes     |
| Inputs | -      | List of tool function parameters and its assignments | -       |


## Outputs

The output is the `return` value of the python tool function. For example, consider the following python tool function:

```python
from promptflow import tool

@tool
def my_python_tool(message: str) -> str:
    return 'hello ' + message
```

If the input message is "world", the output is `hello world`.

### Types

| Type                                                | Python example                  | Description                                |
|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| int                                                 | param: int                      | Integer type                               |
| bool                                                | param: bool                     | Boolean type                               |
| string                                              | param: str                      | String type                                |
| double                                              | param: float                    | Double type                                |
| list                                                | param: list or param: List[T]   | List type                                  |
| object                                              | param: dict or param: Dict[K, V] | Object type                                |
| Connection                                          | param: CustomConnection         | Connection type will be handled specially |

Parameters with `Connection` type annotation will be treated as connection inputs, which means:
- Prompt flow extension will show a selector to select the connection.
- During execution time, prompt flow will try to find the connection with the name same from parameter value passed in.

> [!Note]
> `Union[...]` type annotation is only supported for connection type, for example, `param: Union[CustomConnection, OpenAIConnection]`.

## Python code input requirements

This section describes requirements of the Python code input for the Python tool.

- Python Tool Code should consist of a complete Python code, including any necessary module imports.
- Python Tool Code must contain a function decorated with `@tool` (tool function), serving as the entry point for execution. The `@tool` decorator should be applied only once within the snippet.
- Python tool function parameters must be assigned in 'Inputs' section
- Python tool function shall have a return statement and value, which is the output of the tool.

The following Python code is an example of best practices:

```python
from promptflow import tool

@tool
def my_python_tool(message: str) -> str:
    return 'hello ' + message
```

## Consume custom connection in the Python tool

If you're developing a python tool that requires calling external services with authentication, you can use the custom connection in prompt flow. It allows you to securely store the access key and then retrieve it in your python code.

### Create a custom connection

Create a custom connection that stores all your LLM API KEY or other required credentials.

1. Go to Prompt flow in your workspace, then go to **connections** tab.
2. Select **Create** and select **Custom**.
3. In the right panel, you can define your connection name, and you can add multiple *Key-value pairs* to store your credentials and keys by selecting **Add key-value pairs**.
4. Besides your key value pairs, please also add following extra meta data to the connection:
    - azureml.flow.connection_type: Custom
    - azureml.flow.module: promptflow.connections
    
    :::image type="content" source="./media/python-tool/custom-connection-meta.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows add extra meta to custom connection in AI studio." lightbox = "./media/python-tool/custom-connection-meta.png"::: 

    
> [!NOTE]
> - You can set one Key-Value pair as secret by **is secret** checked, which will be encrypted and stored in your key value.
> - Make sure at least one key-value pair is set as secret, otherwise the connection will not be created successfully.


### Consume custom connection in Python

To consume a custom connection in your python code, follow these steps:

1. In the code section in your python node, import custom connection library `from promptflow.connections import CustomConnection`, and define an input parameter of type `CustomConnection` in the tool function.
1. Parse the input to the input section, then select your target custom connection in the value dropdown.

For example:

```python
from promptflow import tool
from promptflow.connections import CustomConnection

@tool
def my_python_tool(message: str, myconn: CustomConnection) -> str:
    # Get authentication key-values from the custom connection
    connection_key1_value = myconn.key1
    connection_key2_value = myconn.key2
```
