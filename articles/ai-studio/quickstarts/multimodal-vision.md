# Quickstart: Get started using GPT-4 Turbo with Vision on your images and videos in Azure AI Studio 

[!INCLUDE [Azure AI Studio preview](../includes/preview-ai-studio.md)]

Use this article to get started using [Azure AI Studio](https://ai.azure.com) to deploy and test the GPT-4 Turbo with Vision model. 

GPT-4 Turbo with Vision and [Azure AI Vision](../../ai-services/computer-vision/overview.md) offer advanced functionality including:

- Optical Character Recognition (OCR): Extracts text from images and combines it with the user's prompt and image to expand the context. 
- Object grounding: Complements the GPT-4 Turbo with Vision text response with object grounding and outlines salient objects in the input images.
- Video prompts: GPT-4 Turbo with Vision can answer questions by retrieving the video frames most relevant to the user's prompt.

Extra usage fees might apply for using GPT-4 Turbo with Vision and Azure AI Vision functionality.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription - <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/free/cognitive-services" target="_blank">Create one for free</a>.
- Access granted to Azure OpenAI in the desired Azure subscription.

    Currently, access to this service is granted only by application. You can apply for access to Azure OpenAI by completing the form at <a href="https://aka.ms/oai/access" target="_blank">https://aka.ms/oai/access</a>. Open an issue on this repo to contact us if you have an issue.

- An [Azure AI resource](../how-to/create-azure-ai-resource.md) with a GPT-4 Turbo with Vision model deployed in one of the regions that support GPT-4 Turbo with Vision: Australia East, Switzerland North, Sweden Central, and West US. When you deploy from your project's **Deployments** page, select: `gpt-4` as the model name and `vision-preview` as the model version.
- An [Azure AI project](../how-to/create-projects.md) in Azure AI Studio. 

## Start a chat session to analyze images or video

You need an image to complete the image quickstarts. You can use the following image or any other image you have available. 

:::image type="content" source="../media/quickstarts/multimodal-vision/car-accident.png" alt-text="Photo of a car accident that can be used to complete the quickstart." lightbox="../media/quickstarts/multimodal-vision/car-accident.png":::

You need a video up to three minutes in length to complete the video quickstart.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/quickstarts/multimodal-vision/chat-car-video-reply-insurance.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the chat playground with the assistant's follow-up reply for video analysis." lightbox="../media/quickstarts/multimodal-vision/chat-car-video-reply-insurance.png":::

Below are the known limitations of the video prompt enhancements.

- **Low resolution:** The frames are analyzed using GPT-4 Turbo with Vision's "low resolution" setting, which may affect the accuracy of small object and text recognition in the video.
- **Video file limits:** Both mp4 and mov file types are supported. In the Azure AI Playground, videos must be less than 3 minutes long. When using the API there is no such limitation.
- **Prompt limits:** Video prompts only contain one video and no images. In Playground, you can clear the session to try with another video or images.
- **Limited frame selection:** Currently the system selects 20 frames from the entire video, which might not capture all critical moments or details. Frame selection can either be approximately evenly spread through the video or focused by a specific Video Retrieval query, depending on the prompt.
- **Language support:** Currently, the system primarily supports English for grounding with transcripts. Transcripts don't provide accurate information on lyrics from songs.

At any point in the chat session, you can select the **Show raw JSON** option to see the conversation formatted as JSON. Heres' what it looks like at the beginning of the quickstart chat session:

:::image type="content" source="../media/quickstarts/multimodal-vision/chat-session-json.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the chat session with show raw json selected." lightbox="../media/quickstarts/multimodal-vision/chat-session-json.png":::


```json
[
	{
		"role": "system",
		"content": [
			"You are an AI assistant that helps people find information."
		]
	},
]
```

This has been a walkthrough of GPT-4 Turbo with Vision in the Azure AI Studio chat playground experience. 

## Clean up resources

To avoid incurring unnecessary Azure costs, you should delete the resources you created in this quickstart if they're no longer needed. To manage resources, you can use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true).
