# Role-based access control in Azure AI Studio

[!INCLUDE [Azure AI Studio preview](../includes/preview-ai-studio.md)]

In this article, you learn how to manage access (authorization) to an Azure AI resource. Azure Role-based access control is used to manage access to Azure resources, such as the ability to create new resources or use existing ones. Users in your Microsoft Entra ID are assigned specific roles, which grant access to resources. Azure provides both built-in roles and the ability to create custom roles. 

> [!WARNING]
> Applying some roles might limit UI functionality in Azure AI Studio for other users. For example, if a user's role does not have the ability to create a compute instance, the option to create a compute instance will not be available in studio. This behavior is expected, and prevents the user from attempting operations that would return an access denied error. 

## Azure AI resource vs Azure AI project
In the Azure AI Studio, there are two levels of access: the Azure AI resource and the Azure AI project. The resource is home to the infrastructure (including virtual network setup, customer-managed keys, managed identities, and policies) as well as where you configure your Azure AI services. Azure AI resource access can allow you to modify the infrastructure, create new Azure AI resources, and create projects. Azure AI projects are a subset of the Azure AI resource that act as workspaces that allow you to build and deploy AI systems. Within a project you can develop flows, deploy models, and manage project assets. Project access lets you develop AI end-to-end while taking advantage of the infrastructure setup on the Azure AI resource.

## Default roles for the Azure AI resource 

The Azure AI Studio has built-in roles that are available by default. In addition to the Reader, Contributor, and Owner roles, the Azure AI Studio has a new role called Azure AI Developer. This role can be assigned to enable users to create connections, compute, and projects, but not let them create new Azure AI resources or change permissions of the existing Azure AI resource.

Here's a table of the built-in roles and their permissions for the Azure AI resource:

| Role | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| Owner | Full access to the Azure AI resource, including the ability to manage and create new Azure AI resources and assign permissions. This role is automatically assigned to the Azure AI resource creator|
| Contributor |    User has full access to the Azure AI resource, including the ability to create new Azure AI resources, but isn't able to manage Azure AI resource permissions on the existing resource. |
| Azure AI Developer |     Perform all actions except create new Azure AI resources and manage the Azure AI resource permissions. For example, users can create projects, compute, and connections. Users can assign permissions within their project. Users can interact with existing AI resources such as Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Search, and Azure AI services. |
| Reader |     Read only access to the Azure AI resource. This role is automatically assigned to all project members within the Azure AI resource. |


The key difference between Contributor and Azure AI Developer is the ability to make new Azure AI resources. If you don't want users to make new Azure AI resources (due to quota, cost, or just managing how many Azure AI resources you have), assign the AI Developer role.

Only the Owner and Contributor roles allow you to make an Azure AI resource. At this time, custom roles won't grant you permission to make Azure AI resources.

The full set of permissions for the new "Azure AI Developer" role are as follows:

```json
{
    "Permissions": [ 
        { 
        "Actions": [ 
    
            "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/*/read", 
            "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/*/action", 
            "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/*/delete", 
            "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/*/write" 
        ], 
    
        "NotActions": [ 
            "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/delete", 
            "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/write", 
            "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/listKeys/action", 
            "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/hubs/write", 
            "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/hubs/delete", 
            "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/featurestores/write", 
            "Microsoft.MachineLearningServices/workspaces/featurestores/delete" 
        ], 
        "DataActions": [ 
            "Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/OpenAI/*", 
            "Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/SpeechServices/*", 
            "Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/ContentSafety/*" 
        ], 
        "NotDataActions": [], 
        "Condition": null, 
        "ConditionVersion": null 
        } 
    ] 
}
```
## Default roles for Azure AI projects 

Projects in the Azure AI Studio have built-in roles that are available by default. In addition to the Reader, Contributor, and Owner roles, projects also have the Azure AI Developer role.

Here's a table of the built-in roles and their permissions for the Azure AI project:

| Role | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| Owner | Full access to the Azure AI project, including the ability to assign permissions to project users. |
| Contributor |    User has full access to the Azure AI project but can't assign permissions to project users. |
| Azure AI Developer |     User can perform most actions, including create deployments, but can't assign permissions to project users. |
| Reader |     Read only access to the Azure AI project. |

When a user gets access to a project, two more roles are automatically assigned to the project user. The first role is Reader on the Azure AI resource. The second role is the Inference Deployment Operator role, which allows the user to create deployments on the resource group that the project is in. This role is composed of these two permissions: ```"Microsoft.Authorization/*/read"``` and    ```"Microsoft.Resources/deployments/*"```.

In order to complete end-to-end AI development and deployment, users only need these two autoassigned roles and either the Contributor or Azure AI Developer role on a *project*.

## Sample enterprise RBAC setup
Below is an example of how to set up role-based access control for your Azure AI Studio for an enterprise.

| Persona | Role | Purpose |
| --- | --- | ---|
| IT admin | Owner of the Azure AI resource | The IT admin can ensure the Azure AI resource is set up to their enterprise standards and assign managers the Contributor role on the resource if they want to enable managers to make new Azure AI resources or they can assign managers the Azure AI Developer role on the resource to not allow for new Azure AI resource creation. |
| Managers | Contributor or Azure AI Developer on the Azure AI resource | Managers can create projects for their team and create shared resources (ex: compute and connections) for their group at the Azure AI resource level. |
| Managers | Owner of the Azure AI Project | When managers create a project, they become the project owner. This allows them to add their team/developers to the project. Their team/developers can be added as Contributors or Azure AI Developers to allow them to develop in the project. |
| Team members/developers | Contributor or Azure AI Developer on the Azure AI Project | Developers can build and deploy AI models within a project and create assets that enable development such as computes and connections. |

## Access to resources created outside of the Azure AI resource

When you create an Azure AI resource, the built-in role-based access control permissions grant you access to use the resource. However, if you wish to use resources outside of what was created on your behalf, you need to ensure both: 
- The resource you're trying to use has permissions set up to allow you to access it.
- Your Azure AI resource is allowed to access it. 

For example, if you're trying to consume a new Blob storage, you need to ensure that Azure AI resource's managed identity is added to the Blob Storage Reader role for the Blob. If you're trying to use a new Azure AI Search source, you might need to add the Azure AI resource to the Azure AI Search's role assignments. 

## Manage access with roles 

If you're an owner of an Azure AI resource, you can add and remove roles for the Studio. Within the Azure AI Studio, go to **Manage** and select your Azure AI resource. Then select **Permissions** to add and remove users for the Azure AI resource. You can also manage permissions from the Azure portal under **Access Control (IAM)** or through the Azure CLI. For example, useâ€¯the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/)â€¯to assign the Azure AI Developer role to "joe@contoso.com" for resource group "this-rg" with the following command: 
 
```azurecli-interactive
az role assignment create --role "Azure AI Developer" --assignee "joe@contoso.com" --resource-group this-rg 
```

## Create custom roles

> [!NOTE]
> In order to make a new Azure AI resource, you need the Owner or Contributor role. At this time, a custom role, even with all actions allowed, will not enable you to make an Azure AI resource. 

If the built-in roles are insufficient, you can create custom roles. Custom roles might have read, write, delete, and compute resource permissions in that AI Studio. You can make the role available at a specific project level, a specific resource group level, or a specific subscription level. 

> [!NOTE]
> You must be an owner of the resource at that level to create custom roles within that resource.
