# What's new with Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes

Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes is updated on an ongoing basis. To stay up to date with the most recent developments, this article provides you with information about the latest releases of the [Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes agents](conceptual-agent-overview.md).

When any of the Arc-enabled Kubernetes agents are updated, all of the agents in the `azure-arc` namespace are incremented with a new version number, so that the version numbers are consistent across agents. When a new version is released, all of the agents are upgraded together to the newest version (whether or not there are functionality changes in a given agent), unless you have [disabled automatic upgrades](agent-upgrade.md) for the cluster.

We generally recommend using the most recent versions of the agents. The [version support policy](agent-upgrade.md#version-support-policy) covers the most recent version and the two previous versions (N-2).
