# Quickstart: Connect your Azure DevOps Environment to Microsoft Defender for Cloud

In this quickstart, you will connect your Azure DevOps organizations on the **Environment settings** page in Microsoft Defender for Cloud. This page provides a simple onboarding experience to autodiscover your Azure DevOps repositories.

By connecting your Azure DevOps organizations to Defender for Cloud, you extend the security capabilities of Defender for Cloud to your Azure DevOps resources. These features include:

- **Foundational Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) features**: You can assess your Azure DevOps security posture through Azure DevOps-specific security recommendations. You can also learn about all the [recommendations for DevOps](recommendations-reference.md) resources.

- **Defender CSPM features**: Defender CSPM customers receive code to cloud contextualized attack paths, risk assessments, and insights to identify the most critical weaknesses that attackers can use to breach their environment. Connecting your Azure DevOps repositories allows you to contextualize DevOps security findings with your cloud workloads and identify the origin and developer for timely remediation. For more information, learn how to [identify and analyze risks across your environment](concept-attack-path.md)

API calls that Defender for Cloud performs count against the [Azure DevOps global consumption limit](/azure/devops/integrate/concepts/rate-limits). For more information, see the [common questions about DevOps security in Defender for Cloud](faq-defender-for-devops.yml).

## Prerequisites

To complete this quickstart, you need:

- An Azure account with Defender for Cloud onboarded. If you don't already have an Azure account, [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

## Connect your Azure DevOps organization

To connect your Azure DevOps organization to Defender for Cloud by using a native connector:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).

1. Go to **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Environment settings**.

1. Select **Add environment**.

1. Select **Azure DevOps**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-onboard-ado/devop-connector.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selections for adding Azure DevOps as a connector." lightbox="media/quickstart-onboard-ado/devop-connector.png":::

1. Enter a name, subscription, resource group, and region.

    The subscription is the location where Microsoft Defender for Cloud creates and stores the Azure DevOps connection.

1. Select **Next: select plans**. Configure the Defender CSPM plan status for your Azure DevOps connector. Learn more about [Defender CSPM](concept-cloud-security-posture-management.md) and see [Support and prerequisites](devops-support.md) for premium DevOps security features.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-onboard-ado/select-plans.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows plan selection for DevOps connectors." lightbox="media/quickstart-onboard-ado/select-plans.png":::

1. Select **Next: Configure access**.

1. Select **Authorize**. Ensure you are authorizing the correct Azure Tenant using the drop-down menu in [Azure DevOps](https://aex.dev.azure.com/me?mkt) and by verifying you are in the correct Azure Tenant in Defender for Cloud.

1. In the popup dialog, read the list of permission requests, and then select **Accept**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/quickstart-onboard-ado/accept.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the button for accepting permissions.":::

1. For Organizations, select one of the following options:

    - Select **all existing organizations** to auto-discover all projects and repositories in organizations you are currently a Project Collection Administrator in.
    - Select **all existing and future organizations** to auto-discover all projects and repositories in all current and future organizations you are a Project Collection Administrator in.

    > [!NOTE]
    > **Third-party application access via OAuth** must be set to `On` on for each Azure DevOps Organization. [Learn more about OAuth and how to enable it in your organizations](/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/change-application-access-policies).

    Since Azure DevOps repositories are onboarded at no additional cost, autodiscover is applied across the organization to ensure Defender for Cloud can comprehensively assess the security posture and respond to security threats across your entire DevOps ecosystem. Organizations can later be manually added and removed through **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** > **Environment settings**.

1. Select **Next: Review and generate**.

1. Review the information, and then select **Create**.

> [!NOTE]
> To ensure proper functionality of advanced DevOps posture capabilities in Defender for Cloud, only one instance of an Azure DevOps organization can be onboarded to the Azure Tenant you are creating a connector in.

The **DevOps security** blade shows your onboarded repositories grouped by Organization. The **Recommendations** blade shows all security assessments related to Azure DevOps repositories.
