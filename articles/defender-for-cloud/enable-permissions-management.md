# Enable Permissions Management in Microsoft Defender for Cloud (Preview)

## Overview

Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM) is a security model that helps organizations manage and control user access and entitlements in their cloud infrastructure. CIEM is a critical component of the Cloud Native Application Protection Platform (CNAPP) solution that provides visibility into who or what has access to specific resources. It ensures that access rights adhere to the principle of least privilege (PoLP), where users or workload identities, such as apps and services,  receive only the minimum levels of access necessary to perform their tasks.

Microsoft delivers both CNAPP and CIEM solutions with [Microsoft Defender for Cloud (CNAPP)](defender-for-cloud-introduction.md) and [Microsoft Entra Permissions Management (CIEM)](/entra/permissions-management/overview). Integrating the capabilities of Permissions Management with Defender for Cloud strengthens the prevention of security breaches that can occur due to excessive permissions or misconfigurations in the cloud environment. By continuously monitoring and managing cloud entitlements, Permissions Management helps to discover the attack surface, detect potential threats, right-size access permissions, and maintain compliance with regulatory standards. This makes insights from Permissions Management essential to integrate and enrich the capabilities of Defender for Cloud for securing cloud-native applications and protecting sensitive data in the cloud.

This integration brings the following insights derived from the Microsoft Entra Permissions Management suite into the Microsoft Defender for Cloud portal. For more information, see the [Feature matrix](#feature-matrix).

## Common use-cases and scenarios

Microsoft Entra Permissions Management capabilities are seamlessly integrated as a valuable component within the Defender [Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)](concept-cloud-security-posture-management.md) plan. The integrated capabilities are foundational, providing the essential functionalities within Microsoft Defender for Cloud. With these added capabilities, you can track permissions analytics, unused permissions for active identities, and over-permissioned identities and mitigate them to support the best practice of least privilege.

You can find the new recommendations in the **Manage Access and Permissions** Security Control under the **Recommendations** tab in the Defender for Cloud dashboard.
