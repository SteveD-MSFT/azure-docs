# Protect servers with agentless malware scanning

Microsoft Defender for Cloud's Defender for Servers plan 2 supports an agentless malware scanning capability that scans and detects malware and viruses. The scanner is available for Azure virtual machines (VM), AWS EC2 instances and GCP VM instances.

Agentless malware scanning provides:

- Up-to-date and comprehensive malware detection capabilities that utilize the [Microsoft Defender Antivirus](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/microsoft-defender-antivirus-windows) engine and [cloud protection](/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus) signature feed that Microsoft's intelligence feeds support.

- Quick and full scans that use heuristic and signature-based threat detection.

- Security alerts that are generated when malware is detected. These alerts provide extra details and context for investigations, and are sent to both the Defender for Cloud Alerts page and Defender XDR.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Agentless malware scanning is only available through Defender for Servers plan 2 with agentless scanning enabled.

## Agentless malware detection

Agentless malware scanning offers the following benefits to both protected and unprotected machines:

- **Improved coverage** - If a machine doesn't have an antivirus solution enabled, the agentless detector scans that machine to detect malicious activity.  

- **Detect potential threats** - The agentless scanner scans all files and folders including any files or folders that are excluded from the agent-based antivirus scans, without having an effect on the performance of the machine.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Security alerts appear on the portal only in cases where threats are detected on your environment. If you do not have any alerts it may be because there are no threats on your environment. You can [test to see if the agentless malware scanning capability has been properly onboarded and is reporting to Defender for Cloud](enable-agentless-scanning-vms.md#test-the-agentless-malware-scanners-deployment).

On the Security alerts page, you can [manage and respond to security alerts](managing-and-responding-alerts.md). You can also [review the agentless malware scanner's results](managing-and-responding-alerts.md#review-the-agentless-scans-results). Security alerts can also be [exported to Sentinel](export-to-siem.md).
