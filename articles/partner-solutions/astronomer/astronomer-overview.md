# What is Apache Airflow on Astro – An Azure Native ISV Service (Preview)?

Azure Native ISV Services enable you to easily provision, manage, and tightly integrate independent software vendor (ISV) software and services on Azure. This service is developed and managed together by Microsoft and Astronomer.

You can find Apache Airflow on Astro – An Azure Native ISV Service (Preview) in the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/?Azure_Marketplace_Astronomer_assettypeoptions=%7B%22Astronomer%22%3A%7B%22options%22%3A%22%22%7D%7D#browse/Astronomer.Astro%2Forganizations) or get it on [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/astronomer1591719760654.astronomer?tab=Overview).

This offering allows you to manage your Astro resource as an integrated native service. You can easily run and manage as many Airflow deployments as you need and get started seamlessly through Azure portal.

You can set up the Astro resources through a resource provider named `astronomer.astro`. You can create and manage the billing, resource creation, and authorization of Astro resources through the Azure portal. Astronomer owns and runs the Software as a Service (SaaS) application including the Astro resources created.

Here are the key capabilities provided by the Astro integration:

- **Seamless onboarding** on Astro as an integrated service on Azure.
- **Unified billing** of Astro through monthly billing through Azure Marketplace.
- **Single-Sign on to Astro** - No separate sign-up needed from the Astronomer portal.
- **Manage all Astro resources** from the Azure portal, and track them in the **All resources** page with your other Azure resources.
