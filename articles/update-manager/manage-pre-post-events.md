## Timeline of schedules for pre and post events

**We recommend you to go through the following table to understand the timeline of the schedule for pre and post events.**

For example, if a maintenance schedule is set to start at **3:00 PM**, with the maintenance window of 3 hours and 55 minutes for **Guest** maintenance scope, following are the details: 

| **Time**| **Details** |
|----------|-------------|
|2:19 PM | You can edit the machines and/or dynamically scope the machines up to 40 minutes before a scheduled patch run with an associated pre event. After this time, the resources will be included in the subsequent schedule run and not the current run. </br> **Note**</br> If you're creating a new schedule or editing an existing schedule with a pre event, you need at least 40 minutes prior to the maintenance window for the pre event to run. </br></br> In this example, if you have set a schedule at 3:00 PM, you can modify the scope 40 mins before the set time that is at, 2.19 PM. |
|2:30 PM | The pre event has 20 mins to complete before the patch installation begins to run. </br></br> In this example, the pre event is initiated at 2:30 PM. |
|2:50 PM | The pre event has 20 mins to complete before the patch installation begins to run. </br> **Note** </br> - If the pre event continues to run beyond 20 mins, the patch installation goes ahead irrespective of the pre event run status. </br> - If you choose to cancel the current run, you can cancel using the cancelation API 10 mins before the schedule. In this example, by 2:50 PM you can cancel either from your script or Azure function code. </br> If cancelation API fails to get invoked or hasn't been set up, the patch installation proceeds to run. </br> </br> In this example, the pre event should complete the tasks by  2:50 PM. If you choose to cancel the current run, the latest time that you can invoke the cancelation API is by 2:50 PM. |
|3:00 PM | As defined in the maintenance configuration, the schedule gets triggered at the specified time. </br> In this example, the schedule is triggered at 3:00 PM. | 
|6:55 PM | The post event gets triggered after the defined maintenance window completes. If you have defined a shorter maintenance window of 2 hrs, the post maintenance event will trigger after 2 hours and if the maintenance schedule is completed before the stipulated time of 2 hours that is, in 1 hr 50 mins, the post event will start. </br></br> In this example, if the maintenance window is set to the maximum, then by 6:55 PM the patch installation process is complete and if you have a shorter maintenance window, the patch installation process is completed by 5:00 PM. |
|7:15 PM| After the patch installation, the post event runs for 20 mins. </br>In this example, the post event is initiated at 6:55 PM and completed by 7:15 PM and if you have a shorter maintenance window, the post event is triggered at 5:00 PM and completed by 5:20 PM. |

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to have atleast 40 minutes before the scheduled maintenance run time (3:00 PM in above example) otherwise it might lead to auto-cancellation of that particular scheduled run.

## Configure pre and post events on existing schedule

You can configure pre and post events on an existing schedule and can add multiple pre and post events to a single schedule. To add a pre and post event, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and go to **Azure Update Manager**.
1. Under **Manage**, select **Machines**, **Maintenance Configurations**.
1. On the **Maintenance Configuration** page, select the maintenance configuration to which you want to add a pre and post event.
1. On the selected **Maintenance configuration** page, under **Settings**, select **Events**. Alternatively, under the **Overview**, select the card **Create a maintenance event**.
   
   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-pre-post-events/create-maintenance-event-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the options to select to create a maintenance event." lightbox="./media/manage-pre-post-events/create-maintenance-event-expanded.png":::
   
1. Select **+Event Subscription** to create Pre/Post Maintenance Event.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-pre-post-events/maintenance-events-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the maintenance events." lightbox="./media/manage-pre-post-events/maintenance-events-expanded.png":::

1. On the **Create Event Subscription** page, enter the following details:
    - In the **Event Subscription Details** section, provide an appropriate name. 
    - Keep the schema as **Event Grid Schema**.
    - In the **Event Types** section, **Filter to Event Types**, select the event types that you want to get pushed to the endpoint or destination. You can select between **Pre Maintenance Event** and **Post Maintenance Event**.
    - In the **Endpoint details** section, select the endpoint where you want to receive the response from. It would help customers to trigger their pre or post event.  
       
      :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-pre-post-events/create-event-subscription.png" alt-text="Screenshot on how to create event subscription.":::

1. Select **Create** to configure the pre and post events on an existing schedule.  

> [!NOTE]
> - The pre and post event can only be created at a scheduled maintenance configuration level.
> - The pre and post event run falls outside of the schedule maintenance window.

## View pre and post events

To view the pre and post events, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and go to **Azure Update Manager**.
1. Under **Manage**, select **Machines**, **Maintenance Configurations**.
1. On the **Maintenance Configuration** page, select the maintenance configuration to which you want to add a pre and post event.
1. Select **Overview** and check the **Maintenance events**.

## Cancel a schedule from a pre event

To cancel the schedule, you must call the cancelation API in your pre event to set up the cancelation process that is in your Runbook script or Azure function code. Here, you must define the criteria from when the schedule must be canceled. The system won't monitor and won't automatically cancels the schedule based on the status of the pre event. 

There are two types of cancelations:
- **Cancelation by user** - when you invoke the cancelation API from your script or code.
- **Cancelation by system** - when the system invokes the cancelation API due to an internal error. This is done only if the system is unable to send the pre event to the customer's end point that is 30 minutes before the scheduled patching job.

> [!NOTE]
> If the cancelation is done by the system, the upcoming scheduled patching job will be canceled due to the failure of running the pre events by the sytem.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> If the scheduled maintenance job is cancelled by the user using cancelation API or by the system due to any internal failure, post event if subscribed, will be sent to the endpoint configured by the user.
 
### View the cancelation status

To view the cancelation status, follow these steps:

1. In **Azure Update Manager** home page, go to **History**
1. Select by the **Maintenance run ID** and choose the run ID for which you want to view the status.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-pre-post-events/view-cancelation-status-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows how to view the cancelation status." lightbox="./media/manage-pre-post-events/view-cancelation-status-expanded.png":::

You can view the cancelation status from the error message in the JSON. The JSON can be obtained from the Azure Resource Graph (ARG). The corresponding maintenance configuration would be canceled using the Cancelation API.

The following query allows you to view the list of VMs for a given schedule or a maintenance configuration:

```kusto
maintenanceresources  
| where type =~ "microsoft.maintenance/maintenanceconfigurations/applyupdates"  
| where properties.correlationId has "/subscriptions/<your-s-id> /resourcegroups/<your-rg-id> /providers/microsoft.maintenance/maintenanceconfigurations/<mc-name> /providers/microsoft.maintenance/applyupdates/"  
| order by name desc
```

   :::image type="content" source="./media/manage-pre-post-events/cancelation-api-user-inline.png" alt-text="Screenshot for cancelation done by the user." lightbox="./media/manage-pre-post-events/cancelation-api-user-expanded.png" :::

   If the maintenance job is canceled by the system due to any reason, the error message in the JSON is obtained from the Azure Resource Graph for the corresponding maintenance configuration would be **Maintenance schedule canceled due to internal platform failure**.

#### Invoke the Cancelation API

```rest
 C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\ARMClient.exe put https://management.azure.com/<your-c-id-obtained-from-above>?api-version=2023-09-01-preview "{\"Properties\":{\"Status\": \"Cancel\"}}" -Verbose 
```

> [!NOTE]
> You must replace the **Correlation ID** received from the above ARG query and replace it in the Cancelation API.

**Example**
```http 
  C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin\ARMClient.exe put https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/eee2cef4-bc47-4278-b4f8-cfc65f25dfd8/resourcegroups/fp02centraluseuap/providers/microsoft.maintenance/maintenanceconfigurations/prepostdemo7/providers/microsoft.maintenance/applyupdates/20230810085400?api-version=2023-09-01-preview "{\"Properties\":{\"Status\": \"Cancel\"}}" -Verbose
```
