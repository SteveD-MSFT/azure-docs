|-----------------------------|------|--------------|
| [**Vector search, generally available**](vector-search-overview.md) | Feature | Vector search is now supported for production workloads. The previous restriction on customer-managed keys (CMK) is now lifted. [Prefiltering](vector-search-how-to-query.md) and [exhaustive K-nearest neighbor algorithm](vector-search-ranking.md) are also now generally available. |
| [**Semantic ranking, generally available**](semantic-search-overview.md) | Feature | Semantic ranking ([formerly known as "semantic search"](#feature-rename)) is now supported for production workloads.|
| [**Integrated vectorization (preview)**](vector-search-integrated-vectorization.md) | Feature | Adds data chunking and text-to-vector conversions during indexing, and also adds text-to-vector conversions at query time. |
| [**Import and vectorize data wizard (preview)**](search-get-started-portal-import-vectors.md) | Feature | A new wizard in the Azure portal that automates data chunking and vectorization. It targets the [2023-10-01-Preview](/rest/api/searchservice/skillsets/create-or-update?view=rest-searchservice-2023-10-01-preview&preserve-view=true) REST API. | 
| [**Index projections (preview)**](index-projections-concept-intro.md) | Feature | A component of a skillset definition that defines the shape of a secondary index. Index projections are used for a one-to-many index pattern, where content from an enrichment pipeline can target multiple indexes. You can define index projections using the [2023-10-01-Preview](/rest/api/searchservice/skillsets/create-or-update?view=rest-searchservice-2023-10-01-preview&preserve-view=true) REST API, the Azure portal, and any Azure SDK beta packages that are updated to use this feature. |

See [Upgrade REST APIs](search-api-migration.md) for migration steps to generally available features.|
| [**2023-11-01 Management REST API**](/rest/api/searchmanagement/operation-groups?view=rest-searchmanagement-2023-11-01&preserve-view=true) | API | New stable version of the Management REST APIs for control plane operations. This version adds APIs that [enable or disable semantic ranking](/rest/api/searchmanagement/services/create-or-update#searchsemanticsearch). |
| [**Azure OpenAI Embedding skill (preview)**](cognitive-search-skill-azure-openai-embedding.md) | Skill | Connects to a deployed embedding model on your Azure OpenAI resource to generate embeddings during skillset execution. This skill is available through the [2023-10-01-Preview](/rest/api/searchservice/skillsets/create-or-update?view=rest-searchservice-2023-10-01-preview&preserve-view=true) REST API, the Azure portal, and any Azure SDK beta packages that are updated to use this feature.|
| [**Text Split skill (preview)**](cognitive-search-skill-textsplit.md) | Skill | Updated in [2023-10-01-Preview](/rest/api/searchservice/skillsets/create-or-update?view=rest-searchservice-2023-10-01-preview&preserve-view=true) to support native data chunking. |
| [**How vector search and semantic ranking improve your GPT prompts**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwx1DJ0OqCk)| Video | Watch this short video to learn how hybrid retrieval gives you optimal grounding data for generating useful AI responses and enables search over both concepts and keywords. |

## 2022 announcements

| Month | Item |
|-------|---------|
| November | **Add search to websites** series, updated versions of React and Azure SDK client libraries: <ul><li>[C#](tutorial-csharp-overview.md)</li><li>[Python](tutorial-python-overview.md)</li><li>[JavaScript](tutorial-javascript-overview.md) </li></ul> "Add search to websites" is a tutorial series with sample code available in three languages. If you're integrating client code with a search index, these samples demonstrate an end-to-end approach to integration. |
| November | **Retired** - [Visual Studio Code extension for Azure AI Search](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-azurecognitivesearch/blob/main/README.md). |
| November | [Query performance dashboard](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-samples-search-evaluation). This Application Insights sample demonstrates an approach for deep monitoring of query usage and performance of an Azure AI Search index. It includes a JSON template that creates a workbook and dashboard in Application Insights and a Jupyter Notebook that populates the dashboard with simulated data. |
| October | [Compliance risk analysis using Azure AI Search](/azure/architecture/guide/ai/compliance-risk-analysis). On Azure Architecture Center, this guide covers the implementation of a compliance risk analysis solution that uses Azure AI Search. |
| October | [Beiersdorf customer story using Azure AI Search](https://customers.microsoft.com/story/1552642769228088273-Beiersdorf-consumer-goods-azure-cognitive-search). This customer story showcases semantic search and document summarization to provide researchers with ready access to institutional knowledge. |
| September |  [Event-driven indexing for Azure AI Search](https://github.com/aditmer/Event-Driven-Indexing-For-Cognitive-Search/blob/main/README.md). This C# sample is an Azure Function app that demonstrates event-driven indexing in Azure AI Search. If you've used indexers and skillsets before, you know that indexers can run on demand or on a schedule, but not in response to events. This demo shows you how to set up an indexing pipeline that responds to data update events. |
| August | [Tutorial: Index large data from Apache Spark](search-synapseml-cognitive-services.md). This tutorial explains how to use the SynapseML open-source library to push data from Apache Spark into a search index. It also shows you how to make calls to Azure AI services to get AI enrichment without skillsets and indexers. |
| June | [Semantic search (preview)](semantic-search-overview.md). New support for Storage Optimized tiers (L1, L2). |
| June | **General availability** - [Debug Sessions](cognitive-search-debug-session.md).|
| May | **Retired** - [Power Query connector preview](/previous-versions/azure/search/search-how-to-index-power-query-data-sources).  |
| February | [Index aliases](search-how-to-alias.md). An index alias is a secondary name that can be used to refer to an index for querying, indexing, and other operations. When index names change, for example if you version the index, instead of updating the references to an index name in your application, you can just update the mapping for your alias. |

## Service rebrand

This service has had multiple names over the years. Here they are in reverse chronological order:

+ **Azure AI Search** (November 2023) Renamed to align with Azure AI services and customer expectations.
+ **Azure Cognitive Search** (October 2019) Renamed to reflect the expanded (yet optional) use of cognitive skills and AI processing in service operations.
+ **Azure Search** (March 2015) The original name.

## Service updates

[Service update announcements](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/?product=search&status=all) for Azure AI Search can be found on the Azure web site.

## Feature rename

Semantic search was renamed to [semantic ranking](semantic-search-overview.md) in November 2023 to better describe the feature, which provides L2 ranking of an existing result set.
