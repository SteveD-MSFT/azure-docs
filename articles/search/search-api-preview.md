## Using preview features

Experimental features are available through the preview REST API first, followed by Azure portal, and then the Azure SDKs. 

The following statements apply to preview features:

+ Preview features are available under [Supplemental Terms of Use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/), without a service level agreement.
+ Preview features might undergo breaking changes if a redesign is required. 
+ Sometimes preview features don't make it into a GA release.

## Preview feature support in Azure SDKs

Each Azure SDK team releases beta packages on their own timeline. Check the change log for mentions of new features in beta packages:

+ [Change log for Azure SDK for .NET](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/Azure.Search.Documents_11.5.0-beta.5/sdk/search/Azure.Search.Documents/CHANGELOG.md)
+ [Change log for Azure SDK for Java](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-java/blob/azure-search-documents_11.5.11/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/CHANGELOG.md)
+ [Change log for Azure SDK for JavaScript](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/%40azure/search-documents_11.3.3/sdk/search/search-documents/CHANGELOG.md)
+ [Change log for Azure SDK for Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/blob/azure-search-documents_11.3.0/sdk/search/azure-search-documents/CHANGELOG.md).

## How to call a preview REST API

Preview REST APIs are accessed through the api-version parameter on the URI. Older previews are still operational but become stale over time and aren't updated with new features or bug fixes.

For content operations, [**`2023-10-01-Preview`**](/rest/api/searchservice/search-service-api-versions#2023-10-01-Preview) is the most recent preview version. The following example shows the syntax for [Search POST (preview)](/rest/api/searchservice/documents/search-post?view=rest-searchservice-2023-10-01-preview&preserve-view=true):

```rest
GET {endpoint}/indexes('{indexName}')?api-version=2023-10-01-Preview
```

For management operations, [**`2021-04-01-Preview`**](/rest/api/searchmanagement/management-api-versions#2021-04-01-Preview) is the most recent preview version. The following example shows the syntax for Update Service 2021-04-01-preview version.

```rest
PATCH https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Search/searchServices/{searchServiceName}?api-version=2021-04-01-preview
{
  "location": "{{region}}",
  "sku": {
    "name": "basic"
  },
  "properties": {
    "replicaCount": 3,
    "partitionCount": 1,
    "hostingMode": "default"
  }
}
```
