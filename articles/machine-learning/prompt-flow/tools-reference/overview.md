# Overview of tools in prompt flow
This page provides an overview of the tools that are available in prompt flow. It also offers instructions on how to create your own custom tool and how to install custom tools.


## An index of tools
The following table shows an index of tools in prompt flow.

| Tool name | Description | Environment | Package name |
|------|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| [Python](./python-tool.md) | Runs Python code. | Default | [promptflow-tools](https://pypi.org/project/promptflow-tools/) |
| [LLM](./llm-tool.md) | Uses Open AI's large language model (LLM) for text completion or chat. | Default | [promptflow-tools](https://pypi.org/project/promptflow-tools/) |
| [Prompt](./prompt-tool.md) | Crafts a prompt by using Jinja as the templating language. | Default | [promptflow-tools](https://pypi.org/project/promptflow-tools/) |
| [Embedding](./embedding-tool.md) | Uses Open AI's embedding model to create an embedding vector that represents the input text. | Default | [promptflow-tools](https://pypi.org/project/promptflow-tools/) |
| [Open Model LLM](./open-model-llm-tool.md) | Uses an open-source model from the Azure Model catalog, deployed to an Azure Machine Learning online endpoint for large language model Chat or Completion API calls. | Default | [promptflow-tools](https://pypi.org/project/promptflow-tools/) |
| [Serp API](./serp-api-tool.md) | Uses Serp API to obtain search results from a specific search engine. | Default | [promptflow-tools](https://pypi.org/project/promptflow-tools/) |
| [Content Safety (Text)](./content-safety-text-tool.md) | Uses Azure Content Safety to detect harmful content. | Default | [promptflow-tools](https://pypi.org/project/promptflow-tools/) |
| [Azure OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo with Vision (preview)](./azure-open-ai-gpt-4v-tool.md) | Use AzureOpenAI GPT-4 Turbo with Vision model deployment to analyze images and provide textual responses to questions about them. | Default | [promptflow-tools](https://pypi.org/project/promptflow-tools/) |
| [Faiss Index Lookup](./faiss-index-lookup-tool.md) | Searches a vector-based query from the Faiss index file. | Default | [promptflow-vectordb](https://pypi.org/project/promptflow-vectordb/) |
| [Vector DB Lookup](./vector-db-lookup-tool.md) | Searches a vector-based query from existing vector database. | Default | [promptflow-vectordb](https://pypi.org/project/promptflow-vectordb/) |
| [Vector Index Lookup](./vector-index-lookup-tool.md) | Searches text or a vector-based query from Azure Machine Learning vector index. | Default | [promptflow-vectordb](https://pypi.org/project/promptflow-vectordb/) |

To discover more custom tools developed by the open-source community, see [More custom tools](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/integrations/tools/index.html). 
  
  
## Remarks
- If existing tools don't meet your requirements, you can [develop your own custom tool and make a tool package](https://microsoft.github.io/promptflow/how-to-guides/develop-a-tool/create-and-use-tool-package.html). 
- To install custom tools or add more tools to the custom environment, see [Custom tool package creation and usage](../how-to-custom-tool-package-creation-and-usage.md#prepare-runtime) to prepare the runtime. Then the tools can be displayed in the tool list.
