    questions:
      - question: How many Microsoft Intune licenses do I need for Dev Box?
        answer: Every Dev Box user needs one Microsoft Intune license and can create multiple dev boxes. 

      - question: Which repository providers does Dev Box support?
        answer: Dev Box supports GitHub, Azure Repos, and Bitbucket repositories to provide an image gallery for Dev Box.  
                For more information, see [Configure Azure Compute Gallery for Microsoft Dev Box](how-to-configure-azure-compute-gallery.md)

      - question: Dev boxes that I create from my custom image take an hour to provision and up to 30 minutes to start. How do I make provisioning and startup faster? # Question.
        answer: |
          When you create a generalized VM to capture to an image, the following issues can affect provisioning and startup times:
          1. Enable the Read/Write cache on the OS disk. 
             - To verify, open the Azure portal and navigate to the image. Select **JSON view**, and make sure `properties.storageProfile.osDisk.caching` value is `ReadWrite`.
          2. Create the image using the following sysprep options:
            `/generalize /oobe /mode:vm`.
             - These options prevent a lengthy search for and installation of drivers during the first boot.
          3. Enable nested virtualization in your base image.
             - In the UI, open **Turn Windows features on or off** and select **Virtual Machine Platform**. 
             - Or run the following PowerShell command, Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -FeatureName VirtualMachinePlatform -Online 
          4. Disable the reserved storage state feature in the image by using the following command: 
            `DISM.exe /Online /Set-ReservedStorageState /State:Disabled`.

      - question: Why does it take 25 minutes or more to provision a dev box?
        answer: The provisioning process for a dev box involves interacting with several services, including authenticating with Microsoft Entra ID. The new dev box must be created, initiate networking connectivity services, authenticate to and join the Microsoft Entra ID, register with Intune, and check for any Microsoft Entra security requirements. Depending on the complexity of the dev box definition, there might also be installation and configuration tasks on the dev box itself to provide you with the environment you need to start work. When your dev box is fully provisioned, it's running, ready for you to sign in.

      - question: Where should I create my Dev Center, Projects and Pools for my team for optimal performance?
        answer: |
          Your Dev Center and Projects are generally created where your resources are located. For example, if your headquarters is in California, we would recommend the West US region. 
          
          For optimal latency, we recommend creating pools close to the developer's physical location. For example, if a developer is based in India, we recommend creating a dev box in the Central India region. This is generally thought of as a best practice to improve typing speeds as developers work within their dev boxes.  

          Developers primarily spend their time typing and moving their mouse within their Dev Box. We recommend optimizing for typing latency, since these actions affect development teams the most. 
      
      - question: Can I look up in which regions I should create my pools?  
        answer: |
          Whether you're creating a new pool, or choosing a pool for creating a dev box, it's important to optimize for latency and performance. It can be difficult to determine the optimal region for developers to host their dev boxes.  

          For best results, we recommend that admins ask the developers to use the [Azure Virtual Desktop Experience Estimator](https://aka.ms/avd-estimator). This tool estimates the connection round trip time (RTT) from the developer's physical location, through the Azure Virtual Desktop service, to each Azure region in which you can deploy your dev box. The highlighted region is the region with the lowest RTT from your current location. This is the region where the developer experiences optimal connectivity.  

          If there isn't a pool for that region yet, we recommend that you create a new pool for that region or for the next best option according to the estimator.  
     
      - question: How are backup, high-availability, and disaster recovery implemented in Microsoft Dev Box? 
        answer: |
          Microsoft Intune provides backup functionality for dev boxes. It automatically sets regular restore points, and enables you to create a manual restore point, just as you would for a [Cloud PC](/windows-365/enterprise/create-manual-restore-point).
          Restore functionality for dev boxes is provided by sharing Cloud PC restore points to a storage account. For more information, see: [Share Cloud PC restore points to an Azure Storage Account](/windows-365/enterprise/share-restore-points-storage) 

          Dev Box doesn't provide high-availability and disaster recovery functions. If there's an Azure regional outage, customers lose access to Dev Box in that region. They must implement manual disaster recovery and re-create new Dev Boxes.
          Customers should design and implement high-availability and disaster recovery solutions that suit their requirements. 

      - question: What is the preferred monitoring solution for capturing metrics, usage, number of dev boxes assigned per developer, and so on?
        answer: |
           - Project admins can view dev box usage at pool level. Project admins can select a pool and see list of dev boxes that are currently in use.
           - For Dev Box connectivity metrics, use the [Cloud PC connection quality report (preview)](/windows-365/enterprise/report-cloud-pc-connection-quality). Dev Box is built on top of Cloud PC. So, you can see the connectivity health of each dev box by using the Cloud PC dashboard in the Microsoft Intune admin center.  
    
      - question: Can I use a smart card, or other device that connects to my physical machine with Dev Box?
        answer: Yes. Dev Box users can use smart card and other devices that are connected to the physical machine. Since Dev Box uses same RDP client as Azure Virtual Desktop, you can review following documentation to learn about all the different capabilities supported by RDP client. You can also review RDP client capabilities on different operating systems.

      - question: What if I use Linux as my development environment?
        answer: Microsoft Dev Box supports Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for Linux scenarios. This support enables users to use Linux environment alongside Windows tools. GitHub users who use VS Code for development can use GitHub Codespaces.  

      - question: What should I do when a network connection health check fails?
        answer: Dev Box service is built on top of Windows 365 Enterprise and uses the same [Azure network connection health checks](/windows-365/enterprise/health-checks). Such health checks ensure that Dev Box provisioning is successful and end-user experiences are optimal. If a health check fails, select *view details* to see what is causing the failure and address the issue from there. For example, your network policy might block the following service URLs and ports [Network requirements for Windows 365](/windows-365/enterprise/requirements-network?tabs=enterprise%2Cent#allow-network-connectivity).
        
      - question: Is there a policy or a feature to prevent users copying data or code from the Dev Box to their laptop using the clipboard? 
        answer: You can prevent users copying data or code from the Dev Box to their local machine by disabling the clipboard redirection feature in the RDP client. You can manage this setting through a device configuration policy in Microsoft Intune. For more information, see [RDP device redirection settings](/windows-365/enterprise/manage-rdp-device-redirections#rdp-device-redirection-settings).
