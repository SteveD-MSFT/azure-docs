### November 2023 release

#### Introducing Bilingual Speech Modeling!
We're thrilled to unveil a groundbreaking addition to our real-time speech modeling—Bilingual Speech Modeling. This significant enhancement allows our speech model to seamlessly support bilingual language pairs, such as English and Spanish, as well as English and French. This feature empowers users to effortlessly switch between languages during real-time interactions, marking a pivotal moment in our commitment to enhancing communication experiences.
 
Key Highlights:
- Bilingual Support: With our latest release, users can seamlessly switch between English and Spanish or between English and French during real-time speech interactions. This functionality is tailored to accommodate bilingual speakers who frequently transition between these two languages.
- Enhanced User Experience: Bilingual speakers, whether at work, home, or in various community settings, will find this feature immensely beneficial. The model's ability to comprehend and respond to both English and Spanish in real time opens up new possibilities for effective and fluid communication.
 
How to Use:

Choose es-US (Spanish and English) or fr-CA (French and English) when you call the Speech Service API or try it out on Speech Studio. Feel free to speak either language or mix them together—the model is designed to adapt dynamically, providing accurate and context-aware responses in both languages.

It's time to elevate your communication game with our latest feature release—seamless, multilingual communication at your fingertips!

#### Speech To text models update

We're excited to introduce a significant update to our speech models, promising enhanced accuracy, improved readability, and refined entity recognition. This upgrade comes with a robust new structure, bolstered by an expanded training dataset, ensuring a marked advancement in overall performance. It includes newly released models for en-US, zh-CN, ja-JP, it-IT, pt-BR, es-MX, es-ES, fr-FR, de-DE, ko-KR, tr-TR, sv-SE, and he-IL.

Highlights:
- Better accuracy with new model structure: The redefined model structure, coupled with a richer training dataset, elevates accuracy levels, promising more precise speech output.
- Readability improvement: Our latest model brings a substantial boost to readability, enhancing the coherence and clarity of spoken content.
- Advanced entity recognition: Entity recognition receives a substantial upgrade, resulting in more accurate and nuanced results.

Potential impacts: Despite these advancements, it's crucial to be mindful of potential impacts:
- Custom Silence Timeout Feature: Users employing custom silence timeout, especially with low settings, might encounter over-segmentation and potential omissions of single-word phrases.
- The new model might exhibit compatibility issues with the Keyword prefix feature, and users are advised to assess its performance in their specific applications.
- Reduced disfluency words or phrases: Users might notice a reduction in disfluency words or phrases like "um" or "uh" in the speech output.
- Inaccuracies in word timestamp duration: Some disfluency words might display inaccuracies in timestamp duration, requiring attention in applications dependent on precise timing.
- Confidence score distribution variance: Users relying on confidence scores and associated thresholds should be aware of potential variations in distribution, necessitating adjustments for optimal performance.
- The accuracy enhancement of the phrase list feature might be affected by the misrecognition of certain phrases.

We encourage you to explore these improvements and consider potential issues for a seamless transition, and as always, your feedback is instrumental in refining and advancing our services.
