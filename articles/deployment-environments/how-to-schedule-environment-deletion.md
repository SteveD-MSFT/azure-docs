# Schedule a deletion date for a deployment environment

In this article, you learn how to set an expiration, or end date for a deployment environment. On the expiration date, Azure Deployment Environments automatically deletes the environment and all its resources. If your timeline changes, you can change the expiration date.

Working with many deployment environments across multiple projects can be challenging. Scheduled deletion helps you manage your environments by automatically deleting them on a specific date at a specific time. Using automatic expiry and deletion helps you keep track of your active and inactive environments and helps you avoid paying for environments that you no longer need. 

## Prerequisites

- Access to a project that has at least one environment type.
- The [Deployment Environments User](how-to-configure-deployment-environments-user.md) role, the [DevCenter Project Admin](how-to-configure-project-admin.md) role, or a [built-in role](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md) that has the required permissions to create an environment.

## Add an environment

Schedule an expiration date and time as you create an environment through the developer portal.

1. Sign in to the [developer portal](https://devportal.microsoft.com).
1. From the **New** menu at the top left, select **New environment**.

1. In the Add an environment pane, select the following information:

   |Field  |Value  |
   |---------|---------|
   |Name     | Enter a descriptive name for your environment. |
   |Project  | Select the project you want to create the environment in. If you have access to more than one project, you see a list of the available projects. |
   |Type     | Select the environment type you want to create. If you have access to more than one environment type, you see a list of the available types. |
   |Definition | Select the environment definition you want to use to create the environment. You see a list of the environment definitions available from the catalogs associated with your dev center. |
   |Expiration | Select **Enable scheduled deletion**. |

   If your environment is configured to accept parameters, you're able to enter them on a separate pane. In this example, you don't need to specify any parameters.

1. Under **Expiration**, select a **deletion date**, and then select a **deletion time**. 
   The date and time you select is the date and time that the environment and all its resources are deleted. If you want to change the date or time, you can do so later.

   You can also specify a time zone for the expiration date and time. Select **Time zones** to see a list of time zones.
 
   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-schedule-environment-deletion/select-time-zones.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Add environment pane with time zones link highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-schedule-environment-deletion/select-time-zones.png":::
 
1. Make sure that the time zone reflects the time zone you want to use for the expiration date and time. Select the time zone you want to use.

1. Select **Create**. You see your environment in the developer portal immediately, with an indicator that shows creation in progress.

## Change an environment expiration date and time

Plans change, projects change, and timelines change. If you need to change the expiration date and time for an environment, you can do so in the developer portal.

1. Sign in to the [developer portal](https://devportal.microsoft.com).
 
1. On the environment you want to change, select the Actions menu, and then select **Change expiration**.
 
   :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-schedule-environment-deletion/environment-tile-actions.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the developer portal, showing an environment tile with the actions menu open, and Change expiration highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-schedule-environment-deletion/environment-tile-actions.png":::

1. In Change expiration, you can change any of the following options:
   - Clear **Enable scheduled deletion** to disable scheduled deletion. 
   - Select a new date for expiration.
   - Select a new time for expiration.
   - Select a new time zone for expiration.

1. When you've set the new expiration date and time, select **Change**.
