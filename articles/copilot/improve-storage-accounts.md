# Improve security and resiliency of storage accounts using Microsoft Copilot for Azure (preview)

Microsoft Copilot for Azure (preview) can provide contextual and dynamic responses to harden the security posture and enhance data resiliency of [storage accounts](/azure/storage/common/storage-account-overview).

Responses are dynamic and based on your specific storage account and settings. Based on your prompts, Microsoft Copilot for Azure (preview) runs a security check or a data resiliency check, and provides specific recommendations to improve your storage account.
