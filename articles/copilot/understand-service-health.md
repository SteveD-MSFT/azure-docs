# Understand service health events and status using Microsoft Copilot for Azure (preview)

You can ask Microsoft Copilot for Azure (preview) questions to get information from [Azure Service Health](/azure/service-health/overview). This provides a quick way to find out if there are any service health events impacting your Azure subscriptions. You can also get more information about a known service health event.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](includes/preview-note.md)]

## Sample prompts

Here are a few examples of the kinds of prompts you can use to get service health information. Modify these prompts based on your real-life scenarios, or try additional prompts about specific service health events.

- "Am I impacted by any service health events?"
- "Is there any outage impacting me?"
- "Can you tell me more about this tracking ID {0}?"
- "Is the event with tracking ID {0} still active?"
- "What is the status of the event with tracking ID {0}"

## Examples

You can ask "**Is there any Azure outage ongoing?**" In this example, no outages or service health issues are found. If there are service health issues impacting your account, you can ask further questions to get more information.
