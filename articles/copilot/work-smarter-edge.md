# Work smarter with your Azure Stack HCI clusters using Microsoft Copilot for Azure (preview)

Microsoft Copilot for Azure (preview) can help you identify problems and get information about your [Azure Stack HCI](/azure-stack/hci/overview) clusters.

If the context of a query isn't clear, you'll be prompted to clarify what you're looking for.
