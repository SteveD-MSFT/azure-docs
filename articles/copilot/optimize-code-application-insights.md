# Discover performance recommendations with Code Optimizations using Microsoft Copilot for Azure (preview)

Microsoft Copilot for Azure (preview) can provide [Code Optimizations](/azure/azure-monitor/insights/code-optimizations) for Application Insights resources that have an active [Application Insights Profiler](/azure/azure-monitor/profiler/profiler-settings). This lets you view recommendations tailored to your app to help optimize its performance.

When you ask Microsoft Copilot for Azure (preview) to provide these recommendations, it automatically pulls context from an open Application Insights blade or App Service blade to display available recommendations specific to that app. If the context isn't clear, you'll be prompted to choose an Application Insights resource from a resource selector page.

## Sample prompts

Here are a few examples of the kinds of prompts you can use with Code Optimizations. Modify these prompts based on your real-life scenarios, or try additional prompts about specific areas for optimization.

- "Show my code performance recommendations"
- "Any available app code optimizations?"
- "Code optimizations in my app"
- "My app code is running slow"
- "Make my app faster with a code change"

## Examples

In this example, Microsoft Copilot for Azure (preview) responds to the prompt, "**Any code performance optimizations?**" The response notes that there are 6 recommendations, providing the option to view either the top recommendation or all recommendations at once.
