# Quality of Experience - Affirmed MCC Data Product overview

The *Quality of Experience - Affirmed MCC* Data Products support data analysis and insight for operators of the Affirmed Networks Mobile Content Cloud (MCC). They ingest Event Data Records (EDRs) from MCC network elements, and then digest and enrich this data to provide a range of visualizations for the operator.  Operator data scientists have access to the underlying enriched data to support further data analysis.

## Background

The Affirmed Networks Mobile Content Cloud (MCC) is a virtualized Evolved Packet Core (vEPC) that can provide the following functionality.

- Serving Gateway (SGW) routes and forwards user data packets between the RAN and the core network.
- Packet Data Network Gateway (PGW) provides interconnect between the core network and external IP networks.
- Gi-LAN Gateway (GIGW) provides subscriber-aware or subscriber-unaware value-added services (VAS) without enabling MCC gateway services, allowing operators to take advantage of VAS while still using their incumbent gateway.
- Gateway GPRS support node (GGSN) provides interworking between the GPRS network and external packet switched networks.
- Serving GPRS support node and MME (SGSN/MME) is responsible for the delivery of data packets to and from the mobile stations within its geographical service area.
- Control and User Plane Separation (CUPS), an LTE enhancement that separates control and user plane function to allow independent scaling of functions.

The data produced by the MCC varies according to the functionality.  This variation affects the enrichments and visualizations that are relevant.  Azure Operator Insights provides the following Quality of Experience Data Products to support specific MCC functions.

- **Quality of Experience - Affirmed MCC GIGW**
- **Quality of Experience - Affirmed MCC PGW/GGSN**

## Data types

The following data types are provided for all Quality of Experience - Affirmed MCC Data Products.

- *edr* contains data from the Event Data Records (EDRs) written by the MCC network elements.  EDRs record each significant event arising during calls or sessions handled by the MCC. They provide a comprehensive record of what happened, allowing operators to explore both individual problems and more general patterns.
- *edr-sanitized* contains data from the *edr* data type but with personal data suppressed. Sanitized data types can be used to support data analysis while also enforcing subscriber privacy.

## Setup

To use the Quality of Experience - Affirmed MCC Data Product:

1. Deploy the Data Product by following [Create an Azure Operator Insights Data Product](data-product-create.md).
1. Configure your network to provide data by setting up an MCC EDR Ingestion Agent. The MCC EDR Ingestion Agent uploads EDRs from your network to Azure Operator Insights. See [Create and configure MCC EDR Ingestion Agents for Azure Operator Insights](how-to-install-mcc-edr-agent.md). Alternatively, you can provide your own ingestion agent.
