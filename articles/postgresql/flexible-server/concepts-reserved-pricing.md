# Prepay for Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server compute resources with reserved capacity

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-postgresql-single-flexible-server](../includes/applies-to-postgresql-single-flexible-server.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-database-for-postgresql-single-server-deprecation](../includes/azure-database-for-postgresql-single-server-deprecation.md)]

Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server now helps you save money by prepaying for compute resources compared to pay-as-you-go prices. With Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server reserved capacity, you make an upfront commitment on Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server for a one or three year period to get a significant discount on the compute costs. To purchase Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server reserved capacity, you need to specify the Azure region, deployment type, performance tier, and term.

## How does the instance reservation work?

You don't need to assign the reservation to specific Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instances. An already running Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instance (or ones that are newly deployed) automatically get the benefit of reserved pricing. By purchasing a reservation, you're prepaying for the compute costs for one or three years. As soon as you buy a reservation, the Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server compute charges that match the reservation attributes are no longer charged at the pay-as-you go rates. A reservation doesn't cover software, networking, or storage charges associated with the Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instances. At the end of the reservation term, the billing benefit expires, and the vCores used by Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instances are billed at the pay-as-you go price. Reservations don't auto-renew. For pricing information, see the [Azure Database for PostgreSQL reserved capacity offering](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/postgresql/).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Reserved capacity pricing is available for [Azure Database for PostgreSQL single server](../single-server/overview-single-server.md) and [Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server](overview.md) deployment options.

You can buy Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server reserved capacity in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Pay for the reservation [up front or with monthly payments](../../cost-management-billing/reservations/prepare-buy-reservation.md). To buy the reserved capacity:

* You must be in the owner role for at least one Enterprise or individual subscription with pay-as-you-go rates.
* For Enterprise subscriptions, **Add Reserved Instances** must be enabled in the [EA portal](https://ea.azure.com/). Or, if that setting is disabled, you must be an EA Admin on the subscription.
* For Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program, only the admin agents or sales agents can purchase Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server reserved capacity. </br>

The details on how enterprise customers and Pay-As-You-Go customers are charged for reservation purchases, see [understand Azure reservation usage for your Enterprise enrollment](../../cost-management-billing/reservations/understand-reserved-instance-usage-ea.md) and [understand Azure reservation usage for your Pay-As-You-Go subscription](../../cost-management-billing/reservations/understand-reserved-instance-usage.md).

## Reservation exchanges and refunds

You can exchange a reservation for another reservation of the same type, you can also exchange a reservation from Azure Database for PostgreSQL single server with Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server. It's also possible to refund a reservation, if you no longer need it. The Azure portal can be used to exchange or refund a reservation. For more information, see [Self-service exchanges and refunds for Azure Reservations](../../cost-management-billing/reservations/exchange-and-refund-azure-reservations.md).

## Reservation discount

You may save up to 65% on compute costs with reserved instances. In order to find the discount for your case, visit the [Reservation blade on the Azure portal](https://aka.ms/reservations) and check the savings per pricing tier and per region. Reserved instances help you manage your workloads, budget, and forecast better with an upfront payment for a one-year or three-year term. You can also exchange or cancel reservations as business needs change.

## Determine the right server size before purchase

The size of reservation should be based on the total amount of compute used by the existing or soon-to-be-deployed servers within a specific region and using the same performance tier and hardware generation.

For example, let's suppose that you're running one general purpose Gen5 – 32 vCore PostgreSQL database, and two memory-optimized Gen5 – 16 vCore PostgreSQL databases. Further, let's suppose that you plan to deploy another general purpose Gen5 – 8 vCore database server, and one memory-optimized Gen5 – 32 vCore database server, within the next month. Let's suppose that you know that you need these resources for at least one year. In this case, you should purchase a 40 (32 + 8) vCores, one-year reservation for single database general purpose - Gen5 and a 64 (2x16 + 32) vCore one year reservation for single database memory optimized - Gen5.

The following table describes required fields.

| Field | Description |
| :------------ | :------- |
| Subscription   | The subscription used to pay for the Azure Database for PostgreSQL reserved capacity reservation. The payment method on the subscription is charged the upfront costs for the Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server reserved capacity reservation. The subscription type must be an enterprise agreement (offer numbers: MS-AZR-0017P or MS-AZR-0148P) or an individual agreement with pay-as-you-go pricing (offer numbers: MS-AZR-0003P or MS-AZR-0023P). For an enterprise subscription, the charges are deducted from the enrollment's Azure Prepayment (previously called monetary commitment) balance or charged as overage. For an individual subscription with pay-as-you-go pricing, the charges are billed to the credit card or invoice payment method on the subscription.
| Scope | The vCore reservation’s scope can cover one subscription or multiple subscriptions (shared scope). If you select: </br></br> **Shared**, the vCore reservation discount is applied to Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instances running in any subscriptions within your billing context. For enterprise customers, the shared scope is the enrollment and includes all subscriptions within the enrollment. For Pay-As-You-Go customers, the shared scope is all Pay-As-You-Go subscriptions created by the account administrator.</br></br>**Management group**, the reservation discount is applied to Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instances running in any subscriptions that are a part of both the management group and billing scope.</br></br> **Single subscription**, the vCore reservation discount is applied to Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instances in this subscription. </br></br> **Single resource group**, the reservation discount is applied to Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instances in the selected subscription and the selected resource group within that subscription.
| Region | The Azure region that’s covered by the Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server reserved capacity reservation.

| Performance Tier | The service tier for the Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instances.
| Term | One year
| Quantity | The amount of compute resources being purchased within the Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server reserved capacity reservation. The quantity is a number of vCores in the selected Azure region and Performance tier that are being reserved and get the billing discount. For example, if you're running or planning to run Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server instances with the total compute capacity of Gen5 16 vCores in the East US region, then you would specify quantity as 16 to maximize the benefit for all servers.

## Reserved instances API support

Use Azure APIs to programmatically get information for your organization about Azure service or software reservations. For example, use the APIs to:

- Find reservations to buy
- Buy a reservation
- View purchased reservations
- View and manage reservation access
- Split or merge reservations
- Change the scope of reservations

For more information, see [APIs for Azure reservation automation](../../cost-management-billing/reservations/reservation-apis.md).

## vCore size flexibility

vCore size flexibility helps you scale up or down within a performance tier and region, without losing the reserved capacity benefit. If you scale to higher vCores than your reserved capacity, you're billed for the excess vCores using pay-as-you-go pricing.

## How to view reserved instance purchase details

You can view your reserved instance purchase details via the [Reservations menu on the left side of the Azure portal](https://aka.ms/reservations).

## Reserved instance expiration

You receive email notifications, the first one 30 days prior to reservation expiry and another one at expiration. Once the reservation expires, deployed VMs  continue to run and be billed at a pay-as-you-go rate.
