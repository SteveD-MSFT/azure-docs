# How to optimize performance when using `pgvector` on Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server

[!INCLUDE [applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server](../includes/applies-to-postgresql-flexible-server.md)]

The `pgvector` extension adds an open-source vector similarity search to Azure Database for PostgreSQL flexible server.

This article explores the limitations and tradeoffs of [`pgvector`](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) and shows how to use partitioning, indexing and search settings to improve performance.

For more on the extension itself, see [basics of `pgvector`](how-to-use-pgvector.md). You might also want to refer to the official [README](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector/blob/master/README.md) of the project.

## Next steps

Congratulations, you just learned the tradeoffs, limitations and best practices to achieve the best performance with `pgvector`.
