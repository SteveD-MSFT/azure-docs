# Integrate Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server with Azure Cognitive Services (Preview)

Azure AI extension gives the ability to invoke the [language services](../../ai-services/language-service/overview.md#which-language-service-feature-should-i-use) such as sentiment analysis right from within the database.

## Prerequisites

1. [Create a Language resource](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextAnalytics) in the Azure portal to get your key and endpoint.  
1. After it deploys, select **Go to resource**.

> [!NOTE]
> You will need the key and endpoint from the resource you create to connect the extension to the API.

## Configure Azure Cognitive Services endpoint and key 

In the Language resource, under **Resource Management** > **Keys and Endpoints** you can find the endpoint and keys for your language resource. Use the endpoint and key to enable `azure_ai` extension to invoke the model deployment.

```postgresql
select azure_ai.set_setting('azure_cognitive.endpoint','https://<endpoint>.cognitiveservices.azure.com'); 
select azure_ai.set_setting('azure_cognitive.subscription_key', '<API Key>'); 
```

### `azure_cognitive.analyze_sentiment`

[Sentiment analysis](../../ai-services/language-service/sentiment-opinion-mining/overview.md) provides sentiment labels (`negative`,`positive`,`neutral`) and confidence scores for the text passed to the model.

```postgresql
azure_cognitive.analyze_sentiment(text text, language text, timeout_ms integer DEFAULT 3600000, throw_on_error boolean DEFAULT TRUE, disable_service_logs boolean DEFAULT false)
```

#### Arguments

##### `text`

`text` input to be processed.

##### `language`

`text` two-letter ISO 639-1 representation of the language that the input text is written in. Check [language support](../../ai-services/language-service/concepts/language-support.md) for allowed values.

##### `timeout_ms`

`integer DEFAULT 3600000` timeout in milliseconds after which the operation is stopped.

##### `throw_on_error`

`boolean DEFAULT true` on error should the function throw an exception resulting in a rollback of wrapping transactions.

##### `disable_service_logs`

`boolean DEFAULT false` the Language service logs your input text for 48 hours solely to allow for troubleshooting issues. Setting this property to `true` disables input logging and might limit our ability to investigate issues that occur.

For more information, see Cognitive Services Compliance and Privacy notes at https://aka.ms/cs-compliance, and Microsoft Responsible AI principles at https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai.

#### Return type

`azure_cognitive.sentiment_analysis_result` a result record containing the sentiment predictions of the input text. It contains the sentiment, which can be `positive`, `negative`, `neutral` and `mixed`; and the score for positive, neutral and negative found in the text represented as a real number between 0 and 1. For example in `(neutral,0.26,0.64,0.09)`, the sentiment is `neutral` with `positive` score at `0.26`, neutral at `0.64` and negative at `0.09`.


### `azure_cognitive.detect_language`
